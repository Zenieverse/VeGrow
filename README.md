# VeGrow
VeGrow — Decentralized dApp Incubator &amp; Reward Hub. A permissionless incubator where builders register dApps, contributors fund and test them, and users earn B3TR rewards (on-chain) for useful activity — onboarding builders &amp; users to VeChain.

Problem, solution & why blockchain
Problem
Early-stage dApps struggle to find users, measurable support, and funding.
Users want simple incentives to test and adopt new apps.
Centralized incubators are opaque and gatekeep grants — slow and expensive.
Solution
A decentralized incubator where any builder can register a project, set milestones and reward budgets in B3TR.
Contributors stake or fund projects (native VET or stable on-chain assets), participate in testing, and earn on-chain B3TR rewards that are claimable via the VeWorld wallet.
Reputation & milestone completion is recorded immutably on VeChainThor — transparent funding flows and verifiable outcomes.
Why blockchain
Immutable milestone records + transparent reward distribution removes trust friction for sponsors, builders and testers.
Native token (B3TR) as incentive enables immediate composability with other dApps in the VeChain ecosystem.
On-chain reputation and funds reduces friction for scaling to hundreds of thousands of users.
AI added value
AI scoring can be used to pre-evaluate submissions and triage low-effort projects off-chain (or via oracles) and publish scores on-chain in metadata. (Implementation notes below.)
